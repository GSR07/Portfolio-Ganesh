## 🧠 1. Foundations of Robotic Prosthetics

### 🔌 Neural & Myoelectric Interfaces
- Most advanced prostheses interpret muscle signals (EMG) from residual limbs for intuitive control.
- Phantom Neuro's minimally invasive muscle-implanted sensors are entering trials, achieving 94% gesture accuracy.

### 🦴 Osseointegration & Muscle Reconnection
- Bionic limbs are now directly integrated into bone via titanium implants.
- New surgical techniques preserve and rewire muscle groups, allowing brain-like control over prostheses.

### 🧠 AI & Smart Control
- Prosthetics equipped with embedded AI systems can adapt to different tasks and environments in real-time.
- AI-decoders analyze nerve or muscle data to allow natural movement of multiple fingers simultaneously.
